	<div class="section-header">Finding gold in rivers:</div>
	<div class="section-content">
		<p>
			My experience has shown that gold is likely to collect in a stream bed. Other obstacles include bedrock ridges and large fallen trees. The obstacles can be even more productive if they are in that shortest, straightest path down the streambed.
		</p>
		<p>
			Most streams do not travel in a straight line for very long either horizontally or vertically. The inside of the bends and where the stream levels out after a <b>steeper run</b> are good places for pay streaks to form.
		</p>
		<p>
			Due to gold's high density it will travel along the <b>lowest points of the riverbed</b>, it will usually dig its way all the way down to bedrock along with other heavy elements such as silver, tin, platinum and the magnetic sand called hematite and magnetite. Gold will do most of its moving during periods of intense flooding – areas picked clean of gold by previous prospectors will usually refill their gold reserves after heavy flooding.

	<div class="section-header">Finding gold mines:</div>
	<div class="section-content">
		<p>Dad’s friend John did some research and found that once we have the technology
			 to mine, we should be looking for gold in these places:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><b>Correct Topography:</b>
				As a general concept, the coarser gold does tend to hang up farther upstream.
				 In the deserts, most of the best residual placers form in areas with moderate to flat slopes.
			 </li>
			<li><b>Productive Rock Types:</b>
				The concept of favorable host rocks is an important one, but the types of rock which constitute “favorable” can vary a lot from one location to another and can be significantly different.
			</li>
			<li><b>Rock Contact Zones and Faults:</b>
				Many quartz veins and other hard rock gold deposits occur in "zones" along faults or at the contact of two different types of rock.
			</li>
			<li><b>Quartz Vein Matter Accumulations:</b>
				At times, small accumulations of quartz vein material can indicate mineralization in the area.
				This is a very common indicator.
			</li>
			<li><b>Similar Geologic Areas Nearby:</b>
				If a certain rock type or geologic environment has been productive for gold in one area, and the same rock type or environment occurs a few miles away in the same mountain range, it may well be worthwhile to investigate.
			</li>
			<li><b>Extensions of Known Mineral or Placer Areas:</b>
				 Other than pipe shaped bodies, most small scale gold deposits have a linear component.
				 It is fairly common that new deposits can be found along this linear zone of deposition by looking for extensions along the line of deposition.
			 </li>
			<li><b>Color Changes:</b>
				In many districts, acidic mineral solutions have bleached the area rocks to a lighter color.
				This can be an indicator of gold.
			</li>
			<li><b>Iron Staining & Gossans:</b> Not all veins produce much quartz
				– gold bearing veins can consist of calcite or mostly sulfides -
				 which often weather into iron stained spots when the pyrites convert to iron oxides.
				 Large amounts of iron oxides like hematite, magnetite and ironstone can be favorable indicators.
			</li>
		</ol>

<div class="section-header">Heat Maps and Temperatures</div>
	<div class="section-content">
		<ul>
			<li>When looking at a heat map, red is hot and blue is cold.</li>
			<li>The temperature of mountains decreases as their elevation increases.</li>
			<li>Deeper bodies of water tend to be colder than shallower bodies of water.</li>
			<li>There is not always a correlation between temperature and height. This depends on the climate as well.</li>
		</ul>
