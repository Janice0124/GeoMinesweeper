	<h1>Notes from Dad</h1>
	<div class="section-header">Finding gold in rivers:</div>
	<p>
		My experience has shown that gold is likely to collect in a stream bed.
		Other obstacles include bedrock ridges and large fallen trees.
		The obstacles can be even more productive if they are in that shortest,
		 straightest path down the streambed.
	</p>
	<p>
		Most streams do not travel in a straight line for very long either horizontally or vertically.
		The inside of the bends and where the stream
		levels out after a steeper run are good places for pay streaks to form.
	</p>

	<div class="section-header">Finding gold mines:</div>
	<p>Dad’s friend John did some research and found that once we have the technology
		 to mine, we should be looking for gold in these places:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Color Changes:
		In many districts, acidic mineral solutions have bleached the area rocks to a lighter color.
		This can be an indicator of gold.</li>
		<li>Iron Staining & Gossans: Not all veins produce much quartz
			– gold bearing veins can consist of calcite or mostly sulfides -
			 which often weather into iron stained spots when the pyrites convert to iron oxides.
			 Large amounts of iron oxides like hematite, magnetite and ironstone can be favorable indicators.</li>
		<li>Quartz Vein Matter Accumulations:
			At times, small accumulations of quartz vein material can indicate mineralization in the area.
			This is a very common indicator.</li>
		<li>Productive Rock Types:
			The concept of favorable host rocks is an important one, but the types of rock which constitute “favorable” can vary a lot from one location to another and can be significantly different.
		</li>
		<li>Rock Contact Zones and Faults:
			Many quartz veins and other hard rock gold deposits occur in "zones" along faults or at the contact of two different types of rock.
		</li>
		<li>Correct Topography:
			As a general concept, the coarser gold does tend to hang up farther upstream.
			 In the deserts, most of the best residual placers form in areas with moderate to flat slopes.
		 </li>
		<li>Extensions of Known Mineral or Placer Areas:
			 Other than pipe shaped bodies, most small scale gold deposits have a linear component.
			 It is fairly common that new deposits can be found along this linear zone of deposition by looking for extensions along the line of deposition.
		 </li>
		<li>Similar Geologic Areas Nearby:
			If a certain rock type or geologic environment has been productive for gold in one area, and the same rock type or environment occurs a few miles away in the same mountain range, it may well be worthwhile to investigate.
		</li>
	</ol>
