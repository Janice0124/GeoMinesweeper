		  		The year is 1846 and you get by as a mid-level banker in the big city. The city life and the east coast has been good to you but you can’t help but think about something greater that lies out west. Your dad has been making a decent living as a gold-miner in the California territory for a few years now but that back-breaking life isn’t for you. You’re comfortable at the bank and it pays the bills.
		  	</p>

			<p>
				A few days later, you receive an ominous-looking letter. Your dad passed last week. You two always wrote letters back and forth but hadn’t seen each other for years. As you continue to read, you realize that your dad has left you all of his land in California. He’d always made a good living with painstaking work but you’ve heard rumors of riches to be had out west. That banking job doesn’t feel so cozy anymore; you want the open land, the open air, and the freedom of the frontier.  There was an even a guy in your office that quit his job a couple of weeks ago to move out west. You were secretly jealous of the care-free look on his face. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Your dad left you some notes and tips on how to get started once you get there but you want to turn his land into the fortune it can really be. Use maps, the latest technology, and your best intuition to turn this small operation into an empire. Can you be the most prosperous gold miner in all of California?
